Inappropriate platform for academic
Most project discussions among university students and announcements by academic staff are primarily conducted on social media platforms, which were not initially designed or intended to serve as virtual workspaces. This practice leads to challenges such as buried documents amidst numerous messages, causing inconvenience when accessing essential files and media. Additionally, the lack of notifications for document updates or edits hampers efficient collaboration among group members and lecturers involved in the same project.

Social media distractions and disorganization
In academic settings, social media platforms are often utilized for group discussions and announcements, alongside personal or non-academic conversations. This overlapping usage leads to unorganized chats, difficulty in categorizing information, and inefficient teaching and learning processes. The tendency for social media to be distracting further undermines focus and productivity during academic tasks.

Unorganized task management
Students struggle to balance academic and co-curricular commitments due to difficulties in organizing their schedules and meeting deadlines. The absence of a clear visualization of tasks and learning plans exacerbates this challenge. Similarly, academic staff face challenges in scheduling quizzes and tests across different sections, leading to potential overlaps in dates and locations. A solution lies in adopting weekly or monthly calendars, essential tools for enhancing productivity and tracking progress effectively
